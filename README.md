## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line.

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/AffectNeuro_2018Spring

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository. 

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

Joyful, happy, sad, angry, disgusting, painful, bored... we experience these emotions all the time, and these experience keep changing every moment. How can we "define" emotions? How can we "study" emotions? What are the "bodily factors" that influence emotions? How we "measure" bodily response of emotions? What are the "brain representations" of emotions? Are emotions same with affect or feelings? How can we model the "dynamics" of emotions? What are the underlying problems in emotional disorders, like anxiety and depression? etc. There are so many interesting questions about emotions. In this class, you will learn some key topics of affective neuroscience. We will also read and discuss some key papers (one or two papers per week) in affective neurosciences together. 

## Course format and expectations

This course will consist of two parts--lectures and paper presentations. First, for the first 40 or so minutes, we will watch a lecture on an affective neuroscience topic together. The lecture could be my lecture (pre-recorded) or other affective neuroscientists' lecture. We will watch these videos together. Second, for the other 60-90 mins, two students will give presentations on the important papers on affective neuroscience, and we will have a discussion about the paper. Each student will present one paper. We will use English as the main language, but you can use Korean to ask questions and discuss. 

## Evaluation

1. Attendance (40%)
2. Discussion participation (20%)
3. Presentation (20%)
4. Term paper (20%)


## Term paper

You can choose one among the following three options. (1) You can submit a research paper draft if your research topic is related to emotions. The paper should have at least three parts of the full article (e.g., Introduction, Methods, and Results, or Introduction, Results, and Discussion, etc.) (2) You can write about your own research idea on emotions with an experiment plan and design. In this case, you need to write introduction and method sections. ~5 pages (12 pt, line spacing 1.5) (3) You can write about a "perspective" type piece on any issues related to emotion research. Free format, ~5 pages.
